# YLD Code Challenge

## Lazy evaluation

In this challenge, I did a simple implementation of a class `Lazy` to demonstrate the concept of Lazy evaluation using javascript.

I also used `Jest` to create a few test cases, excluding degenerate cases like bad or missing arguments to the class's methods.

I took a little longer than a hour to finish it, as this was a new concept for me, but I'm glag I could finish it and I'll love to receive any feedbacks on the other possible implementations :)
